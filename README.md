Glad to see you here!

I am a passionate Computer Science student with a love for problem-solving, coding, and making a difference through technology.

As a software developer, I focus on creating efficient, user-friendly applications. Whether it's building full-stack projects or working with databases, I believe in using technology to solve real-world problems. I'm particularly skilled at **debugging**, **datbases**, **probelm solving** using tools like **VS Code** and **MYSQL**
